       "Equifax mishandled my information which has led to a breach that puts myself and millions of others at potential risk. I am extremely disappointed with how equifax has handled reporting this breach. Very little was done to notify the public for nearly a month after the breach was detected. I received no email, letter, or phone call and instead had to discover it via social media.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    118\n",

       "Equifax mishandled my information which has led to a breach that puts myself and millions of others at potential risk. I am extremely disappointed with how equifax has handled reporting this breach. Very little was done to notify the public for nearly a month after the breach was detected. I received no email, letter, or phone call and instead had to discover it via social media. \\n\\nGoing forward equifax should be required to monitor every account and notify victims if any fraud occurs. Credit fraud protection should be mandatory for every account, not an option for us to have deal with. \\n\\nThis should be rectified firstly by making credit freezing free and refunding everyone who paid for it following this data breach. Requiring a police report is absurd when they clearly know if you were affected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        36\n",
       "Equifax mishandled my information which has led to a breach that puts myself and millions of others at potential risk. I am extremely disappointed with how Equifax has handled reporting this breach. Very little was done to notify the public for nearly a month after the breach was detected. I received no email, letter, or phone call and instead had to discover it via social media.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     34\n",

       "I have been a victim of Identity Theft. I have been trying to work with the Credit Reporting Agency but they are refusing to honor my valid identity theft case thus these incorrect/fraudulent items are still on my credit report and they must be removed immediately but they are do not belong to me. I have provided all of the proof to show that I was a victim of Identity Theft and that to the best of my knowledge these fraudulent accounts do not belong to me. Please take immediate action on my behalf so I can have these items removed, deleted and permanently blocked from my credit report, so that I can get back on track to a normal life. \\n\\nRegards                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    27\n",
       "I have sent several requests to Experian requesting an investigation of my accounts. It has been months and I still have not received a response to my concerns. The only thing I have received is some automated rejection letter stating that they wo n't do anything to help me ( please see attached ). \\nThis has to be a violation of my rights. I feel like I 've already wasted so much time just trying to get Experian to look at the errors on my credit report and I 'm so frustrated that Experian is intentionally not responding to my inquiries. I need to have this issue resolved immediately. There are many things I need to do with my life and they all involve my credit. But I am not able to move forward all because of this credit bureau!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              26\n",
       "Equifax mishandled my information which has led to a breach that puts myself and millions of others at potential risk. I am extremely disappointed with how equifax has handled reporting this breach. Very little was done to notify the public for nearly a month after the breach was detected. I received no email, letter, or phone call and instead had to discover it via social media. \\nGoing forward equifax should be required to monitor every account and notify victims if any fraud occurs. Credit fraud protection should be mandatory for every account, not an option for us to have deal with. \\nThis should be rectified firstly by making credit freezing free and refunding everyone who paid for it following this data breach. Requiring a police report is absurd when they clearly know if you were affected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            25\n",
       "I filed a complaint stating that the Public Record Information was inaccurate in its filing. As the term \" Dismissed '' means that it is adjudicated by the law. My case concern no form of solvency, nothing was placed under conservancy, examinership, liquidation or provisional debt reconstruction. There were no exemptions, no surrender of any kind as stated within the regulations of the BAPCPA \" Means Test ''. The credit bureaus have retrieve my information from a third party entity without my authorization, therefore holding my identity and credit under \" Consumer Lock '' for 10 years. The Bankruptcy Court has confirmed that they did not verify by documentation and the credit agencies have stated I can no longer challenge this negative entry.

       "I was part of the Equifax credit information hack. I find it unacceptable that I have to PAY to freeze my credit when I did n't consent to my information being stored by Equifax, XXXX, or XXXX in the first place. Congress should make credit freezes and unfreezes free federally. Credit reporting agencies already make money off of my information and I should not be required to pay them additional money to protect my information, especially when they are doing a POOR job in the first place.

To my knowledge I have never entered into a financial agreement with this company and neither have they ever provide me goods nor services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      15\n",
       "( a ) Block. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer ; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer.\\n\\n( b ) Notification. A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section ( 1 ) that the information may be a result of identity theft ; ( 2 ) that an identity theft report has been filed ; ( 3 ) that a block has been requested under this section ; and ( 4 ) of the effective dates of the block.\\n\\n( c ) Authority to decline or rescind.\\n\\n( 1 ) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that ( A ) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error ; ( B ) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block ; or ( C ) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions.\\n\\n( 2 ) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title.\\n\\n( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block.\\n\\n( d ) Exception for resellers.\\n\\n( 1 ) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller ; ( B ) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer ; and ( C ) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft.\\n\\n( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information.\\n\\n( 3 ) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph ( 2 ), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file. Such notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information was obtained for resale.\\n\\n( e ) Exception for verification companies. The provisions of this section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of information described in paragraphs ( 1 ) through ( 3 ) of subsection ( a ) of this section, a check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a ( p ) of this title, any information identified in the subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft.\\n\\n( f ) Access to blocked information by law enforcement agencies. No provision of this section shall be construed as requiring a consumer reporting agency to prevent a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency from accessing blocked information in a consumer file to which the agency could otherwise obtain access under this subchapter.        15\n",
       "While checking my personal credit report, I noticed an unauthorized and fraudulent credit inquiry made by XXXX on or about XX/XX/XXXX on Transunion. I did not authorized anyone employed by this company to make any inquiry and view my credit report. XXXX has violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act Section 1681b ( c ). They were not legally entitled to make this fraudulent inquiry. This is a serious breach of my privacy rights. \\nI have requested that they mail me a copy of my signed authorization form that gave them the right to view my credit within five ( 5 ) business days so that I can verify its validity and advised them that if they can not provide me with proof that I authorized them to view my credit report then I am demanding that they contact the credit bureaus immediately and have them remove the unauthorized and fraudulent hard inquiry immediately. I also requested that they remove my personal information from their records.

       "I am filing this complaint because I think what Experian is doing to me is wrong, unethical and may be against the law. A letter was mailed to Experian on or around [ XXXX/XXXX/15 ]. \\nI clearly stated my concerns to them regarding inaccurate, questionable or unverifiable information listed on my credit report. I also provided a clear copy of my ID, proof of my social security number and a proof of my current mailing address. \\nOn [ XXXX/XXXX/15 ] I received a notice from Experian stating the following : '' We received a suspicious request in the mail regarding your personal credit report and determined that it was not sent by you. Suspicious requests are reviewed by Experian security personnel who work regularly with law enforcement officials and regulatory agencies to identify fraudulent and deceptive correspondence purporting to originate from consumers. \\nIn an effort to safeguard your personal credit information from fraud, we will not be initiating any disputes based on the suspicious correspondence. \\nExperian will apply this same policy to any future suspicious requests that we receive regarding your personal credit information, but we will not send additional notices to you of suspicious correspondence. \\nIf you believe that information in your personal credit report is inaccurate or incomplete, please visit our website at experian.com/validate dispute or call us at XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX to speak directly to an Experian consumer assistance representative. \" However, an Experian confirmation number was not even provided on this notice. I can not imagine what could have possibly been \" suspicious '' about my correspondence to Experian. I should not have to spend endless hours on phone calling the credit bureau back and forth attempting to resolve the issues on my credit report! I am filing this complaint because Experian will not respond to any letters that I am sending in.

       "In XXXX, I requested my free annual credit report. After viewing my credit report, I noticed over XXXX credit/loan inquiries on my account that was not authorized by me. I contacted each company and was told that there was not any account open under my information. I explained that I have a hard inquiry on my credit report and need it removed as soon as possible so that I could apply for a home. I was told that the inquiries would be removed from my credit report. As of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, none of the inquiries have been removed dating back to XXXX. I had a initial fraud alert placed on my report on XXXX XXXX, so if any credit reports are being pulled with my information, I was to be contacted by the company before any action was taken place. I just want the inquiries to be removed so that my scores and credit is not being impacted any longer. I would like to purchase a house, but until all of the inquires are removed I will not be approved with XXXX inquires on my credit report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     13\n",

       "FCRA states information reporting has to be 100 % verifiable and 100 % accurate otherwise the information must be removed under federal law. XXXX has been reporting unverifiable and inaccurate information on my credit which has damaged my credit. I intend to litigate if they do no remove this file from my credit report.

       "Due to illness, I used an XXXX to get to hospital XX/XX/XXXX. The ambulance service sent a bill XX/XX/XXXX which my husband paid online on XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX we received a letter from collection agency saying we did not pay for the XX/XX/XXXX service. We provided to the collection agency both verbally and twice in writing with a partial copy of our credit card report showing we had paid and therefore we believe they submitted a false report to the credit bureau because we would not pay again for the service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\n",
       "I had a Fidelity Rewards credit card issued by U.S. Bancorp that was converted to XXXX XXXX XXXX in the summer of 2016. The advertised rewards from XXXX is that you receive double points for all qualifying purchases and 2 % rebate if the rebate is deposited into a Fidelity account. \\n\\nI have been diligently redeeming my rewards over the past year only to realize that I had only been given 1 % instead of the 2 % as advertised. I never received any information that upon my account converting from Bancorp to XXXX, I was supposed to call to change my rewards level. This was not clear and a very deceptive process for all customers. \\n\\nAll along I was using my card to receive the 2 % and I was only given 1 %.

       "We send seterus a check # XXXX for amount of {$660.00} on XX/XX/2015 seterus mentioned on their monthly statements checks received after XX/XX/2015 will have a late fee added on to, for sure they received the check before XX/XX/2015 but they waited until XX/XX/2015 to cash it so they can add a {$10.00} late fee to it and this was not the first time seterus has done this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\n",
       "An account with the company XXXX was opened in my name in XXXX of 2014 according to the debt collection company AFNI. The origin of this account was based in XXXX, however I lived in XXXX, so this could not have been me. I have contacted XXXX and gotten a letter verifying that they looked into this, and determined it was fraud, and therefor I owe nothing nd the account needs to be closed. AFNI continues to send me letters and ignore the information I have given them several times. hey REFUSE to contact XXXX and close out this false debt against me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n",
       "We have tried to obtain a modification from Wells Fargo and have been denied 5 times in the last few years. We paid our mortgage for 7 years before falling behind this last time. We worked with a Home Preservationist ( XXXX XXXX ) who indicated that we did n't have to keep making payments ; that at the end of the process all the past due would be put at the end of the loan. ( Please see documents at end of email to explain situation ) Please note the last statement we received indicate we were behind 13 payments of XXXX and the form dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX states that the payment was {$980.00} and going to XXXX starting XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, which is not here yet. Also, after all we have gone through they are raising our payment and our interest rate! \\nWe want to keep our home and I have written to the CEO of Wells Fargo via email at least 3 times and he may have referred my inquiry to someone, but he did not answer me at all.

       "In XXXX XXXX we entered into a repayment agreement with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to catch up XXXX late payment of {$1300.00}. We agreed to catch this late payment up by adding an additional amount of {$190.00} on to each payment of {$1300.00}. The new monthly payment amount was {$1500.00}, after the initial forebearance payment of {$1300.00}. These amounts were paid to XXXX ( # XXXX XXXX via money order on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and by phone transfer confirmation # XXXX of XXXX XXXX, XXXX. In late XXXX XXXX we were notified by XXXX that our loan had been transferred to Nationstar Mortgage XXXX # XXXX XXXX. We made our XXXX payment on XXXX XXXX ( check # XXXX ) to Nationstar Mortgage in the amount of {$1500.00} by mail. Our XXXX XXXX payment was made on XXXX XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$1500.00} by cashier check to Nationstar Mortgage by mail. Febuary XXXX payment was made XXXX XXXX XXXX for {$1500.00} by cashier check to Nationstar Mortgage by mail. XXXX XXXX payment was made XXXX XXXX XXXX for {$1500.00} to Nationstar by cashier check. XXXX XXXX paid XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX paid XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) and XXXX XXXX paid XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX of XXXX payments were made to Nationstar also by cashier check in the amount of {$1300.00}. \\nBecause of the sudden transfer of our mortgage loan from XXXX to Nationstar, there was an accounting error in whether we were to pay an additional {$190.00} with our XXXX payment to Nationstar. However, we continued to make regular on-time up to date payments as agreed per the repayment plan. Our continued problem has been that Nationstar Mortgage is continuing to show us being behind in our payments by {$1300.00}, even though our records substantiate that we are not behind by a payment. We will concede that if we are behind at all it would only be for approximately {$370.00}. We have notified Nationstar of this discrepancy and/or error on several occasions to no avail. In addition to continuing to show our mortgage by being behind by a month, Nationstar has incorrectly reported this information on our credit bureau files. Any assistance in rectifying this situation is greatly appreciated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",
       "I received an Email from PNC Bank my Mortgage Company Acct # ( XXXX ) about refinancing, I called and was going to refinance but after I hung up I check and found out that the fees they were charging were not fully disclosed so I cancelled the refinancing within 10 minutes.\\nA week or so after I received a letter from PNC with all the Refinance Information as well as a credit report which i did not order. Everytime someone runs a credit report on you it lowers your score. In the past XXXX XXXX issued my girlfriend a Credit Card without her knowledge and it cost her points on her score. I dont know how PNC can fix my credit score but something has to be done with these Banks doing whatever they want                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",
       "I called the company to get verification of debt. Asked them to send to me in writing. They refused to, They told me that i disputed the debt, I told them i have never talked to them before so how is that even possible. They said once the debt has been disputed, i legally have to pay the debt for it to go away, and they legally do n't have to do anything. I asked them to remove the dispute comment, because i never disputed it. They refused and said federal law says they cant once its been disputed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n",
       "Because of the market crash and my home value decreasing so that I could n't sell it for what was owed and other personal harships, on XX/XX/XXXX 2013 My home was foreclosed. The 1st lienholder XXXX XXXX received release from the 2nd Lien holder XXXX to foreclose on the property. After foreclosure the 1st lien sold the home for the full mortgage amount. I called XXXX the 2nd lien holder to see what would happen at that point since they did not receive money from the sale. They said they filed bankruptcy and wrote it off. Within the next year I started receiving calls from a company called Real Time Resolution who said the debt was sold to them and they are collecting it. Real Time Resolution is showing this debt on my credit as an open mortgage with late payments every month. I did some research and I found that legally XXXX should n't have sold the debt if they filed bankruptcy and wrote it off but even if it is okay for them to do that, the Collection company since they were not the original lien holder can not show this on my credit as an open mortgage with late payments every month and continued interest etc ... I have filed a complaint with the 3 credit bureau companies and Equifax refuses to do anything about how it is being reported ; however the other two have updated it. \\nMy complaint is against Real Time Resolutions and XXXX. Please help me in straightening this out. I understand the debt has to show on my credit report but at some point it will fall off but as long as it shows an open mortgage it will never come off and it looks like I am paying late mortgage payments every month and I am not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",
       "I received a phone call from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX at my parents house about a loan I had with XXXX XXXX that I had trouble paying on from the following telephone number ( XXXX ) XXXX. I talk to a XXXX XXXX and gave him my bank information about trying to get the debt settled he also gave me a direct phone number to his office ( XXXX ). I have not received any written communication from XXXX and unfortunately my check returned due to insignificant funds twice. XXXX XXXX XXXX called me and I tried to get information and every time I mentioned about not getting any written communication from him he got rude. I also asked if I could break the debt into smaller payments he said no and I asked for a company address so I could send a money order he said no also. The agent asked if he can call my parents and asked if they can help with I told him no not to call my parents and only use my number he called me on as contact. The agent then proceded to get rude.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\n",

       "I want to start by saying that Real Time has been nothing but polite and considerate this whole time. I do not fault any of the service reps that I have dealt with. My husband and I obtained a home equity loan through XXXX XXXX 9 years ago that was 125 % of our home value. The market crashed and XXXX went out of business, selling our loan to Real Time Resolution or an investor that they represent for pennies on the dollar. We ended up filing for Chapter XXXX bankruptcy 7 years ago. Our lawyer avoided the lien in the bankruptcy paperwork and Real Time did not file any objections. Our home was very negative at the time. We were able to settle with our 1st mortgage company and have been making payments on time since. This year we are trying to refinance our home mortgage so that we can pay off some extra debt and we have good equity in our home now. I have spent the last several months trying to get a settlement with Real Time. They say that we owe {$69000.00} in principal on the original loan and then want an additional {$75000.00} in interest for the last 8 years of not paying on this second mortgage. They are not on our title and they are not on our credit report and they have not been able to provide me with the documentation stating that they have the authority to remove the lien from our title. They were not willing to present an offer to their investor because it was not enough. Another offer was just made but we are hitting a point were our DTI is going to make this process impossible. I worry that they actually do not have a claim here and that I am going to send them money and nothing will happen except I am now out a lot of money. I have never seen any paperwork stating loan balances but I know that they were not able to bother us because of the bankruptcy laws.

       "XX/XX/XXXX Hello, I did make the make the reservation on the XXXX XXXX, XXXX. On XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX w/Parking Included, for 7 days. From XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. At first They charge the credit card in full at once, i did not have credit line available and still they authorize make the full charge, putting my credit card over draft because of the amount, of XXXX. I book a apartament nice, clean, whit a ocean view, rail on the balcn, and all the amenities. In photos looks perfect when we arrive the first impression was the smell, smells dusty. We left the bags and went to eat, when we came back the smells was still. We call the hotel representative the one i talk that day i arrive, told that she cant do nothing for me beacuse that apartment is private property and dont belong to the Hotel. We start to looking around, the bathroom whit black mold in the toilet, shower and sink. The sink at the kitchen dusty, the countertop as well, the coffemaker whit debris of never been wash, every place were swipe your hand was dusty, the sheets smell bad, the refrigerator whit marks of never been clean but not to said the smell was terrible. A few bulb working in the entire apartament. And not all the light fixtures work. The slidding door for the patio dont have any lock working, how we can feel safe whit that, at the balcn between apartarments have chains instead iron like the pictures. The view at the ocean was a joke we have a mount of gargabe accros our apartament. The extractor at the bathroom was dusty. The AC besides running whit problems for the sounds, the filters was dusty all the way. The walls whit mark of bugs died. The electric box, whit rust, the tray of the of the Little oven dusty and mark of never been wash, all the silverware dusty and wter marks, the fire detector not working besides hanging from cables, the fire valves in case fire, looks dont work at all, cover whit paint and rusty. Black mold at the front door, in every spot. When we walking by the entrance of parking we see a lot of wter falling from the ceilling, when we went toe at, when we came the wter was still falling. I have a lots of pictures to demostrate how bad was. I never imagine that this property was in this bad conditions, i never rent this conditions and the pictures are not acurate because they want to hide the reality of the apartment. The credit card from Bank of America, i sending all paper work, cancellation, and everything. The Manager of the property is the one claiming this charge no idea why, because the apartamnet in manner is private owner, dont belong to the Hotel. She said she take care of the situation when she never did. I dont know she you mean whit \" that she tried to accomodate me \" when i let the lady at the phone that i travel wit a baby of one and hald year old, and nothing happens didn`t care, they never reach us to see a solution like she said. They never went to room to see the bad conditions of the apartment was. We left the hotel at XXXX XXXX knowing nobody in XXXX, my baby, my wife and my self looking for options because of the bad experience whit the Hotel, representative at the phone, and most at all the owner of the apartment. I talk to the owner and besides everything, didn`t want give me a refund because she dont want to accept how bad was the apartment, she was just want to clean it, there were things beyond cleanning. They never told us at the hotel that the reservation was non-refundable at any point in the hotel, the only what they told me was to reach XXXX and explain all this. I left Very uppset for the treatment on the Hotel, the conditions of the apartment, lets a lot to imagination. Even the employees at the door did not recomend staying on the hotel and most of all dont eat in the restaurant, what do you thing that i can imagine if your employees told me this.\\n\\nBank of America its been issue my refund 2 times, but today i check and was one more time the charge on the credit card. I talk whit a lot of people on  XXXX and they said they cant doing nothing thats has to be whit the property and credit card. Thats what i did and still dont solve the situation. \\n\\nAny concern let me know, Thanks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",

       "My personal information may have been compromised in the Equifax security breach earlier this month. In today 's world it is basically impossible to make major purchases without developing some sort of credit history. Essentially consumers are forced into using credit cards, and therefore divulging personal information to 3rd party companies such as Equifax. There should be certain safeguards/security in place to protect this data.

       "Property management company billed me for a cleaning fee after I moved out of the residence. I never was presented with any documentation indicating that I owed a cleaning fee. The debt has been sent to collections for a debt I do not owe. There is now a derogatory entry on my credit report which is an error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",
       "I lost my job in XXXX. I paid XXXX and XXXX and the first payment for XXXX but was unable to pay the second installment for XXXX. I received an email notice of the missed payment on XXXX, which I responded to and received a very cordial response. The day after the email conversation, the phone calls began, up to XXXX calls a day. I have tno is explaining to them even sending a second email stating that I would pay no later than XXXX XXXX, as I have gotten another job with a start date of XXXX/XXXX/17. I finally sent a Cease and Desist email XXXX and another on XXXX after the calls continued.

       "I was stunned once I ordered my XXXX, XXXX and XXXX credit reports and found that I was reported as having a late payment on the date below : 90 days past due as of XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, 120 days due as of XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nI already disputed this with the credit bureaus and they verified it as being accurate. I am not sure how this occurred, I believe that I had made my payments to you on time when I received my statements. My only thought is that this was supposed to be in deferment and it did not get processed correctly or the payments I sent in were not registered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",
       "I am currently in the process of refinancing a loan through XXXX XXXX, my current provider is PNC. As part of the underwriting process XXXX requires that i show 12 months of statements from my PNC account, when i contacted PNC 4 weeks ago they stated they can not provide that information and I need to login to their site to get my statements, they proceeded to tell me i needed a pin to create an account they said it could take 5 business days. When 5 business days went by i called them back they stated i must have missed it?? so they supposedly sent another one again after 5 more days no pin so i called back to speak to a manager which to my surprise was not present at the cll center so again i requested a pin, another 5 days went by and no pin. My next step was to go to the local branch according to the local branch they were on a different system and could not provide statement regarding mortgages. It has now been over 4 weeks since my first request andI still can not access my statements no one has followed up and i feel as though i am being held hostage given i can not provide the necessary required info to refinance this is unbelievable that this kind of thing can happen.
